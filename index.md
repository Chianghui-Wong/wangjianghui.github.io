I am a research scientist at [Beijing Institute of General Artificical Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://bigai.ai/).

I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Song-chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/). Before that, I obtained bachelor degree of Computer Science at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I also received B.E. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My research interests lie in machine learning algorithms and vision-language multimodal learning.
