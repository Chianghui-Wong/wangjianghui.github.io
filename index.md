I received my 本科 from the Department of Computer Science and Technology at [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Yang Yu](https://www.wolai.com/eyounx/dtR1MTyRXS5tP5Cex4KtdK).

My research interests lie in the intersection of pretraining, vision-language modeling. Current research themes include:
- **Robustness Pretraining** Developing models that can generalize across diverse and challenging environments
- **Video Understanding:** General vision-language (VL) understanding and explainable VL modeling.

I am looking for PhD position now.
