I am a research scientist at Beijing Institute of General Artificical Intelligence (BIGAI).

I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science, UCLA, under the supervision of [Prof. Song-chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/). Before that, I obtained bachelor degree of Computer Science at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I also received B.E. degree in Micro-electronic Technology from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My research interests lie in Language and Vision Multi-Modal Learning.
