I am a fifth year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science, UCLA. I am currently doing research on machine learning at [Center for Vision, Cognition, Learning, and Autonomy (VCLA)](https://vcla.stat.ucla.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Song-chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/). Before that, I obtained bachelor degree of Computer Science at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I also received B.E. degree in Micro-electronic Technology from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). My research interests lie in Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing and Cognitive Science.
