I am a research scientist and team lead at [Beijing Institute for General Artificical Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://bigai.ai/).

I received my Ph.D. degree from the Department of Computer Science at [University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)](https://www.cs.ucla.edu/), under the supervision of [Prof. Song-chun Zhu](http://www.stat.ucla.edu/~sczhu/). Before that, I obtained bachelor degree of Computer Science at [University of Minnesota](https://twin-cities.umn.edu/). I also received B.E. degree from University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC). 

My research interests lie in the intersection of statistical machine learning, vision-language modeling and cognition. Current research themes include:
- **Generative Modeling:** Statistical generative modeling (energy-based models) for vision and language.
- **Multimodal Understanding:** General vision-language (VL) understanding and explainable VL modeling.
- **Cognitive Language Reasoning:** Understand and reason underlying information in language and human conversations.

I am always looking for self-motivated **interns** and long-term **collaborators**. Please contact me if you have excellent background or share similar research interests with me.
